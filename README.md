# Artie
An artificially intelligent Discord bot that can feel.

The Artie.py script automatically creates a config file on first run. Edit it to add the Discord bot token required to run.

New responses can be added with the ~define command, for example:
~define would you like tater tots = Yes please! I love tater tots!
