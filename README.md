# Artie

The Artie.py script automatically creates a config file on first run. Edit it to add the Discord bot token required to run.

New responses can be taught with the ~teach command*, for example:
~teach would you like tater tots = Yes please! I love tater tots!


*The AI usually loves to say random garbage instead of what you teach it lol
